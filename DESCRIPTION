Description: pKSEA uses summary statistics calculated from phosphoproteomic data at the peptide level to infer changes in kinase activity across conditions. pKSEA uses kinase-substrate prediction scores to weight observed changes in phosphopeptide abundance to calculate a phosphopeptide-level contribution score, then sums up these contribution scores by kinase to obtain a phosphoproteome-level kinase activity change score (KAC score). pKSEA then assesses the significance of changes in predicted substrate abundances for each kinase using permutation testing. This results in a permutation score (pKSEA significance score) reflecting the likelihood of a similarly high or low KAC from random chance, which can then be interpreted in an analogous manner to an empirically calculated p-value. pKSEA contains default databases of kinase-substrate predictions from NetworKIN (NetworKINPred_db) and of known kinase-substrate links from PhosphoSitePlus (KSEAdb).
