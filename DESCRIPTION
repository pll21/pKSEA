Description: A tool for inferring kinase activity changes from 
    phosphoproteomics data. 'pKSEA' uses kinase-substrate 
    prediction scores to weight observed changes in 
    phosphopeptide abundance to calculate a phosphopeptide-level 
    contribution score, then sums up these contribution scores by 
    kinase to obtain a phosphoproteome-level kinase activity 
    change score (KAC score). 'pKSEA' then assesses the 
    significance of changes in predicted substrate abundances for 
    each kinase using permutation testing. This results in a 
    permutation score (pKSEA significance score) reflecting the 
    likelihood of a similarly high or low KAC from random chance, 
    which can then be interpreted in an analogous manner to an 
    empirically calculated p-value. 'pKSEA' contains default 
    databases of kinase-substrate predictions from 'NetworKIN'
